Machine learning for electrical grid

This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to optimize the usage
of household electricity grids with solar panels and look for efficient ways
to manage their energy consumption, analyze the data from various appliances
in the household and optimize their usage.

The data collected will include information about the appliances in the household,
their usage patterns, and other relevant data.
By analyzing this data, system will be able to identify the most efficient way
to use the available energy sources, resulting in reduced energy bills
for the household.
